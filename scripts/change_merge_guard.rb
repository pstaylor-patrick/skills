# PreToolUse hook: gates a `gh pr merge` that lands into a repo's protected
# branch (staging/production, or whatever CHANGE.md names) on a comprehensive
# cf:change run having passed for the PR's head commit, and enforces the repo's
# own admin-bypass policy from CHANGE.md. Same shape as merge_mode_guard: it
# reads the Bash command text and denies with a reason, a loud guardrail rather
# than a sandbox, bypassable (CF_ALLOW_UNGATED_MERGE=1) for the genuine
# exception.
#
# One file informs the decision: the repo-root CHANGE.md, whose `change_policy:`
# frontmatter block this hook reads. A repo with no CHANGE.md is ungoverned and
# merges freely; presence of CHANGE.md is the opt-in. So this hook never blocks
# an unrelated repo on the machine, only one that has chosen change-fabric
# governance.
