# agent both read (git flow, PR expectations, when admin-bypass merging is
# acceptable), but a hook cannot act on prose, so the machine-checkable subset
# lives in a `change_policy:` YAML frontmatter block, alongside the
# `change_config:` block the audit lanes read. The body is the source of truth a
# person reads; the frontmatter is the same policy stated in a form the merge
# gate can enforce, and the body is expected to explain it.

# Presence of CHANGE.md is itself the signal that a repo has opted into
