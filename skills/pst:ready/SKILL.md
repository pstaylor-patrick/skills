# Bring PRs to Merge-Ready (v2 -- Tournament Protocol)

Drive PRs to merge-ready state. Single PR: run inline. 2+ URLs: dispatcher.

Pipeline: workspace setup (0-1) --> tournament repair (T) --> settling (5.5)
--> PR refresh (6) --> test-plan (7) --> open and summarize (8).

## Input

<arguments> #$ARGUMENTS </arguments>

Flags: `--merge`, `--dry-run`, `--no-open`, `--no-settle`,
`--max-ci-attempts N` (default 3), `--max-review-rounds N` (default 5),
`--max-parallel N` (dispatcher, default 4).

Validate: PR URLs must match `https://github.com/.+/.+/pull/\d+`. Reject bare
numbers. De-duplicate silently. Require `gh` and `git`.

---

## Phase 0 -- Intake and Guards

```bash
PR_JSON=$(gh pr view "$PR_URL" \
  --json number,url,title,state,isDraft,headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,mergeable)
```

Stop if `state != OPEN`. Ask (AskUserQuestion) to proceed if `isDraft`.
Proceed through `CONFLICTING` -- the repair phase resolves it.

---

## Phase 1 -- Workspace Setup

**Same-repo:** worktree at `$REPO_ROOT/.worktrees/ready-PR-$PR_NUMBER` on
`$HEAD_BRANCH` (non-detached so repair can push back).

**Cross-repo:** `gh repo clone $PR_OWNER_REPO $WORK_DIR -- --depth=50` then
`gh pr checkout $PR_NUMBER`.

Set `WORK_DIR`. Add `.pst-ready-progress.json` to `.git/info/exclude`. Write
initial progress (`state`, `completed[]`, metadata). If a progress file from
the last 24 h exists, resume from the first phase not in `completed[]`.

All subsequent commands run inside `$WORK_DIR`.

---

## Tournament Gate

Ask the user (AskUserQuestion):

> Run N=3 repair strategies in parallel? (Yes / Single-path / Abort)

- **Yes:** run Phase T tournament below.
- **Single-path:** run Strategy B only; skip the judge; cherry-pick its commits
  directly in Phase T.3.
- **Abort:** stop cleanly.

In `--dry-run`: skip the gate; log "dry-run: would run tournament N=3" and
continue in read-only mode through all phases.

---

## Phase T -- Repair Tournament

Spawn **3 foreground Sonnet agents** in a single response turn
(`isolation: worktree`, no `run_in_background`). They run concurrently and all
must finish before the judge.

Each agent receives: `PR_URL`, `PR_NUMBER`, `HEAD_BRANCH`, `BASE_BRANCH`,
`HEAD_SHA`, `WORK_DIR`, `MAX_CI_ATTEMPTS`, `MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS`, and its
strategy directive.

### Strategy A -- Conservative

- Rebase: prefer merge over rebase when conflicts exist.
- CI: one `pst:code-review` + fix-sub-agent pass; stop after that budget.
- Threads: run `pst:resolve-threads` for bot-posted threads only
  (`github-actions[bot]`, `codex`, `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`).
- Skip the adversarial code-review settling loop.

### Strategy B -- Structural

- Full `pst:rebase`; squash fixup commits (`git rebase -i --autosquash`).
- Parallel CI-fix sub-agents, one per failing check.
- After CI is green, run `pst:resolve-threads` and `pst:code-review --sweep`
  in parallel.

### Strategy C -- Review-first

- Run `pst:code-review --sweep` first to surface structural issues before
  touching threads.
- Resolve only threads that survive after code-review (skip threads that
  code-review would invalidate).
- CI fix only for issues code-review explicitly flags as auto-fixable.

### Required result block

Each agent must end its response with:

```
---ready-result---
STRATEGY: <A|B|C>
STATUS: ready | blocked: <reason>
HEAD_SHA: <full 40-char sha from: git rev-parse HEAD>
DIFF:
<output of: git diff origin/main..HEAD>
---end-ready-result---
```

If **all 3 agents** are `blocked`, report all reasons and stop. Do not advance
to the judge.

---

## Phase T.2 -- Opus Judge

Parse every `---ready-result---` block. Collect diffs for `STATUS: ready`
agents. If exactly one agent is `ready`, skip the judge and use it as the
winner.

Otherwise, spawn one **background Opus agent** (`model: opus`) and **await its
result** before Phase T.3. Agent input: all `ready` diffs plus this prompt:

> Score each strategy on three axes (1-5 each):
>
> - **Commit graph cleanliness**: squashed, atomic, no merge commits.
> - **CI attempts consumed**: fewer is better.
> - **Review residuals remaining**: unresolved threads, open findings.
>
> Return JSON only -- no prose before or after:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "winner": "A|B|C",
>   "scores": {
>     "A": { "graph": 0, "ci_attempts": 0, "residuals": 0 },
>     "B": { "graph": 0, "ci_attempts": 0, "residuals": 0 },
>     "C": { "graph": 0, "ci_attempts": 0, "residuals": 0 }
>   },
>   "reasoning": "one sentence"
> }
> ```

Log the scores and reasoning before proceeding.

---

## Phase T.3 -- Cherry-pick Winner

Read `HEAD_SHA` from the winning strategy's result block. Cherry-pick the
winner's commits onto `$WORK_DIR`:

```bash
WINNER_COMMITS=$(git log --reverse --format="%H" origin/$BASE_BRANCH..$WINNER_SHA)
for SHA in $WINNER_COMMITS; do
  git cherry-pick "$SHA"
done
git push --force-with-lease origin "$HEAD_BRANCH"
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse "origin/$HEAD_BRANCH")
```

If cherry-pick conflicts, write the diff from the result block to
`/tmp/pst-ready-winner.patch` and apply via `git apply`.

---

## Phase 5.5 -- Eager Settling Loop

Skipped with `--no-settle` or `--dry-run`.

Poll every 180 s (`--settle-interval`). Exit after 3 consecutive clean polls.
Hard timeout: 1800 s (`--settle-timeout`).

Per poll: check for failing CI checks, new unresolved threads (GraphQL
`reviewThreads`), and blocking PR comments (`scripts/scan-blocking-comments.sh`
or inline `gh api` fallback). On a failing check, spawn a CI-fix sub-agent
(isolated worktree), parse `CI_FIX_RESULT={...}`, cherry-pick, push. On new
threads, run `pst:resolve-threads "$PR_URL"`.

Reset `consecutive_clean` to 0 on any remediation. On timeout or unfixable
remediation, halt with a residual report and preserve the progress file.

---

## Phase 6 -- Refresh PR Title and Description

Gather commit log, diff-stat, and existing PR body. Regenerate title (under 70
chars, imperative) and body (Summary bullets, Implementation Notes if notable,
Test Plan checkboxes). Preserve existing `- [x]` boxes. Push via
`gh api repos/$PR_OWNER/$PR_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER --method PATCH`.

---

## Phase 7 -- Test Plan Validation

Parse `- [ ]` items under a `Test plan` heading. Classify as auto-validatable
(lint, typecheck, build, CI-green, grep claims) or manual-only. Run auto-
validatable checks; post one comment via `gh pr comment`; tick `- [x]` for
passed items via PATCH. Skip if no heading or no unchecked items.

---

## Phase 8 -- Open and Summarize

Post an attestation comment (`<!-- pst:ready-attestation -->`). Unless
`--no-open`, `gh pr view "$PR_URL" --web`. Print a terminal summary.

Delete `.pst-ready-progress.json` on success. Preserve on any halt.

If `--merge`: `gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER --squash`, confirm the merge commit on
base, wait for post-merge CI, then delete the progress file. Preserve and warn
on post-merge CI failure.

---

## Dispatcher (2+ URLs)

Group URLs by `owner/repo`. Pre-create worktrees for same-repo PRs at
`$REPO_ROOT/.worktrees/ready-PR-$N`; for foreign repos, clone to one shared
temp dir per repo. Spawn background child agents (capped at `--max-parallel`);
each runs Phases 0-8 and emits on its final line:

```
PST_READY_CHILD_RESULT={"pr_url":"...","status":"READY|BLOCKED|SKIPPED",...}
```

Print a status matrix. Open READY PRs (or all with `--open-all`). On
`BLOCKED`/`ERROR`, preserve the dispatcher progress file so a re-run
re-dispatches only failed children.

---

## Notes

- All pushes use `--force-with-lease`. Never bare `--force`.
- Tournament agents run in isolated sub-worktrees; their commits land on the
  real branch only after the winner is cherry-picked in Phase T.3.
- Resume: `completed[]` lets `/pst:ready $PR_URL` resume from the first
  incomplete phase; tournament gate re-appears if Phase T did not finish.
- Composition: delegates to `pst:rebase`, `pst:resolve-threads`, `pst:code-review`.
