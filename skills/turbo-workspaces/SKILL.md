# Turborepo and npm Workspaces Cheat Sheet

Source: Turborepo task and caching docs + npm workspaces docs

Question: Can tasks run from declared package boundaries and cache correctly?

Favor:
- Declare every package in root `workspaces`.
- Import other packages by workspace package name.
- Put shared task names in `turbo.json`.
- Use `dependsOn: ["^build"]` when consuming built artifacts.
- Declare `outputs` for cacheable build tasks.
- Mark dev servers `persistent: true` and `cache: false`.
- Keep package scripts thin; let turbo orchestrate.

Forbid by default:
- Cross-package relative imports into another package source tree.
- Per-package lockfiles.
- Hidden build outputs outside declared `outputs`.
- Running package-local installs in CI.
- Circular package dependencies.

CI:
- `turbo run lint build test`
- `npm ls --workspaces`
- `! git grep -nP "(\\.\\./){2,}(apps|packages)/" -- 'apps/**' 'packages/**'`

Agent protocol:
1. Keep package boundaries explicit.
2. Move orchestration into `turbo.json`.
3. Declare cache inputs and outputs before tuning.
4. Preserve behavior.
