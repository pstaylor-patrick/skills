# PST Code Review

Trigger: `/pst:code-review <scope>`.

Question: does this finding survive an isolated attempt to refute it? A
plausible-sounding comment that was never checked against the real code is the
AI slop this skill exists to filter out. Silence beats a wrong or nitpicky
comment; when in doubt, drop it.

## Scope

Accepted forms, resolved in this order:

1. A PR URL or `owner/repo#123` / bare `#123` (current repo when owner/repo is
   omitted). Resolve via `pull_request_read`.
2. A branch or ref: diff against the default branch.
3. An explicit file list or glob.
4. A semantic description of a feature ("the auth refactor", "the caching
   layer"): locate the files with Explore/Grep, list what was found, and
   confirm the set before reviewing.
5. The whole repository: only on explicit request. State the file count
   before proceeding, given the cost; the workflow in step 2 shards it
   automatically once that count crosses its threshold.

If scope is ambiguous, ask which PR or files are meant. Do not guess.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve scope to files, a repo, and a head commit.** PR: `pull_request_
   read` with `get_diff`, `get_files`, and `get_comments`/`get_review_
   comments` so ground already covered by a human or a prior review is not
   re-flagged; if the PR's head is not already fetched locally, fetch it
   (e.g. `git fetch origin pull/<N>/head`) so it resolves to a real local
   commit. Everything else: `git diff`, `git show`, or plain reads. Record
   `repoPath` (the local clone's absolute path) and `headSha` (the commit
   whose code is under review, i.e. the PR's head or the branch tip, never
   the merge-base) alongside the file list; step 2 needs a real commit
   worktrees can check out, not a moving branch name.
2. **Run the review workflow.** Call `Workflow` with the script under
   Review workflow script and `args: { files, repoPath, headSha, cap }`
   (`cap` optional, defaults to 15). Invoking this skill is what authorizes
   the `Workflow` call, so no separate orchestration opt-in is needed. The
   script shards a large file set into semantic sections, finds candidates
   per shard (folding the rubric and general lenses into one pass, or
   splitting the rubric lens onto its own cheap-tier call only when a
   shard's file count makes that split a real, separable job), verifies
   every candidate by trying to refute it inside its own throwaway `git
   worktree` of `repoPath` at `headSha`, and independently rechecks every
   P1 before it is allowed to keep that tier. It returns `{ shards, posted,
   droppedForVolume }`; `posted` is the deduped, ranked, capped finding
   list. On a repeat run against the same scope, pass the `scriptPath` the
   first call returned instead of resending `script`, so unchanged stages
   replay from cache.

   `repoPath` matters because the `Agent` tool's `isolation: "worktree"`
   option only ever isolates the *session's own primary repository* (where
   the session started), not an arbitrary path named in a script's args;
   passing it something else silently isolates the wrong tree. When
   `repoPath` is that primary repository this is harmless, but it is not
   what makes verification correct, so the script does not rely on it: every
   Verify and Recheck P1 call is told to create and clean up its own `git
   worktree add`/`remove` of `repoPath` explicitly, which works the same way
   whether `repoPath` is the session's own repo or a separate clone.
3. **Report before posting.** This checkpoint is mandatory on every run and
   is reached even when a finding was already fixed locally: applying a fix
   in the working tree never substitutes for the post-to-PR decision. Show
   `posted` (`path:line`, tier, one line each) plus the shard summary and
   `droppedForVolume` count, and ask whether to post. Skip the ask only when
   the invocation said to post automatically. If the `Workflow` call errored
   or returned no `posted` list, say so explicitly and stop here; do not
   silently fall back to hand-applying fixes without surfacing this report.
4. **Post.**
   - PR scope: `pull_request_review_write` with `create` (no `event`, so it
     stays pending), then `add_comment_to_pending_review` per finding in
     `posted`, anchored to `path`/`line` with the body rendered per Posting
     style below, then `submit_pending` with `event: "COMMENT"`. Never
     `REQUEST_CHANGES` or `APPROVE` unless asked.
     Posting these review comments is not a `git push`, a `gh pr merge`, or
     opening a PR, so the pst merge mode does not gate it: post in every mode
     (Local only included) whenever the user approves in step 3. Merge mode
     restricts only landing code, never review commentary on a PR that
     already exists.
   - Non-PR scope: there is nothing to post to. The curated report to the
     user is the deliverable.

## Review workflow script

Pass this verbatim as `Workflow`'s `script`. It owns everything the old
per-step `Agent` instructions used to describe by hand: sharding, model
tiers, background/parallel dispatch, the P1 double-check, and the
dedupe/rank/cap that turns raw candidates into `posted`. Comment text and
the actual PR post stay outside it (step 3 and 4 above), since posting
needs a human ask this script has no tool to make.

## Model tiers

The script picks a model per call so the cheap tier is used only where the
work is itself high-volume and mechanically separable, never as a reflex:

| Call | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Shard mapping | `opus` | One call gates the whole run; needs real semantic boundaries, not directory splits |
| Find, folded (small shard) | inherit | One pass covering both lenses; no checklist-only slice big enough to split out |
| Find, rubric split (large shard) | `haiku` | Applies an already-written skill's rules across enough files to be its own job |
| Find, general split (large shard) | inherit | No checklist; needs full reasoning to name what a rubric cannot |
| Verify | inherit | Must write and run a real repro or refactor correctly |
| Recheck P1 | `opus` | Low volume, highest stakes: gates a red, auto-apply-diff finding |

## Priority

Assign a tier from what the Verify stage actually proved, never from how
severe it sounds:

| Tier | Bar | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| P1 (red) | Confirmed break: crash, wrong output, security hole, data loss | A reproduction, plus Recheck P1 agreement |
| P2 (yellow) | Confirmed but bounded: real bug/smell needing specific input, config, or scale; or a refactor with verified payoff | A reproduction from Verify |
| P3 (green) | Real but low blast radius, and only worth interrupting for because the fix is a one-line, unambiguous diff | A reproduction from Verify, and a suggestion block (see below) |

Drop anything that only clears the P3 bar and has no suggestion block; it is
noise, not feedback. Every posted finding needs a `title` (see the Verify
prompt above); render the comment body via `ruby
~/.claude/pst/bin/render_finding_comment.rb`, never a hand-written tier
prefix.

## Posting style

One finding, one comment: an emoji-badged tier header (`🔴 P1`, `🟠 P2`,
`🟢 P3`) and title on line 1, then the concrete failure scenario, then the
fix. Before calling `add_comment_to_pending_review`, pipe the finding as
JSON (`{tier, title, scenario, suggestion}`, `scenario` carrying the
evidence-backed detail) to `ruby ~/.claude/pst/bin/render_finding_comment.rb`
on stdin and post its stdout verbatim as the comment body. The script owns
the template, the badge, and the char-budget fallback (drop the suggestion
block, then truncate the scenario) once the finding is over its 640-char
cap; do the prose-trimming judgment call yourself first so the script's
truncation is a safety net, not the first line of defense. No summary of
the summary, no praise, no restating the diff. Apply `pst:ai-slop`'s
punctuation and tone rules to `title` and `scenario` before rendering.

Add a GitHub suggestion block only when the fix is mechanical and
unambiguous from the finding alone (a rename, a null check, an off-by-one,
a dead branch, the exact rubric move a matched skill names) and touches
only the lines already in the diff. Never suggest a diff for anything
needing a judgment call, multiple files, or unclear intent; omit
`suggestion` from the finding instead.
