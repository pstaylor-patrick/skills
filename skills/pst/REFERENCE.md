# /pst reference

Mechanics and detail for the `/pst` skill. Not loaded as doctrine; read it only
when you need specifics. Rule numbers match `SKILL.md`.

## Merge modes (asked at every invoke)

`/pst` asks via `AskUserQuestion` how PRs should land this session, re-asking on
every re-invocation so it can change per repo:

1. **Admin-bypass squash:** `gh pr merge <pr> --squash --admin` as PRs go green.
   For repos you can self-merge.
2. **Auto-merge on approval:** `gh pr merge <pr> --auto --squash`. GitHub merges
   each PR once required approvals and checks pass. For approval-gated repos (for
   example ShirePath, where Conner must approve).
3. **Merge-ready only:** bring PRs to merge-ready, do not enable auto-merge, do
   not admin-bypass; leave the merge to the user.
4. **Local only (rule 18):** never push a branch or touch a remote PR/issue; all
   work stays in local git worktrees and commits, enforced by the guard. The
   intended workflow: validate a complex feature set end to end in the local k3s
   cluster before any GitHub round-trip. Build it across stacked local feature
   branches, deploy to an arbitrary `*.pstaylor.net` subdomain, prove it there
   (rules 8, 14), and only afterward reconcile the stack into real GitHub PRs by
   re-invoking `/pst` under another merge mode. `pst-mode.rb local on` arms it;
   bootstrap clears the marker each invoke, so it resets unless re-selected.

## Deterministic gates in pst-guard.rb (PreToolUse, armed only)

- **No em dash (rule 11):** denies Write/Edit content or git commit messages
  containing U+2014.
- **Model tier (rule 2):** denies an `Agent`/`Task` spawn whose `tool_input.model`
  is unset. Only model is enforceable (effort is not a spawn parameter). Denies
  only when model is absent, so it never blocks a spawn that sets one. Override
  `PST_ALLOW_DEFAULT_MODEL=1`.
- **Merge gate (rules 5 and 7):** intercepts a direct `gh pr merge`:
  - CI (rule 5): runs `gh pr checks`; blocks unless all pass (pending or failing
    block). No checks: allow. Unverifiable (timeout/error): deny. Override
    `PST_ALLOW_RED_MERGE=1`.
  - Review (rule 7): blocks unless a review marker exists for the head commit
    (`pst-reviewed.rb mark`). Override `PST_ALLOW_UNREVIEWED_MERGE=1`.
  - `--auto`: allowed; GitHub holds the merge until its own approval and checks
    gate is satisfied (merge mode 2).
- **Local-only (rule 18, merge mode 4):** when local-only is armed for the
  session, denies any remote-mutating command: `git push`, `gh pr
create|merge|ready|edit|comment|close|reopen`, and `gh issue
create|edit|comment|close|reopen`. Read commands (`gh pr view|checks|list`) are
  unaffected, so local CI inspection and review still work. Armed with
  `pst-mode.rb local on`, reset on each bootstrap. Override `PST_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`.

Example override: `PST_ALLOW_RED_MERGE=1 PST_ALLOW_UNREVIEWED_MERGE=1 gh pr merge 53 --squash --admin`.

## Deterministic helper scripts (Ruby)

- `scripts/pst-mode.rb` bootstrap: install shim, git identity guard, arm session
  (`off` disarms; `foreground on|off` toggles the delegate-nudge escape hatch;
  `local on|off` toggles merge-mode-4 local-only remote-mutation enforcement).
- `scripts/register-hooks.rb` idempotently registers the shim in settings.json.
- `scripts/pst-emdash.rb check|prune [path ...]` finds or strips em dashes.
- `scripts/pst-worktrees.rb [repo_dir]` lists prunable worktrees (rule 4).
- `scripts/pst-reviewed.rb mark|check [sha]` records or checks the review marker
  the merge guard requires (rule 7).
- `scripts/hooks/*.rb` installed hook bodies plus `pst_common.rb` (shared lib).

## Rule detail and examples

- **Rule 2 tiers, Haiku fits:** mechanical rename or import-path rewrite, lint or
  format autofix, single-string copy change, version or changelog bump, deleting
  already-identified dead code, boilerplate from an exact template.
- **Rule 6 band-aids to avoid:** skipping tests, loosening thresholds,
  retry-until-green, swallowing errors.
- **Rule 8 local k8s timing:** inspect `.github/workflows/`. If merge auto-deploys
  to remote, do the local blue-green deploy and E2E validation BEFORE merge so
  remote is never reached unvalidated; otherwise validate post-merge but
  pre-promotion. The local k3s cloud is a safe sandbox (no VPC or
  deploy-permission roadblocks), so heavyweight automated testing is feasible.
- **Rule 13 cue phrases:** "don't stop until you're done", "all the way", "keep
  going till it's green".
- **Rule 15 smell vocabulary:** see `MAINTAINABILITY.md` for the canonical
  16-smell catalog (the single source, shared with rule 23).
- **Rule 17 open-on-post triggers:** `gh pr create`, `gh pr|issue comment`,
  `gh pr|issue edit --body`, and the Jira `createJiraIssue` / `editJiraIssue` /
  `addCommentToJiraIssue` MCP tools. It opens the GitHub URL scraped from command
  output, or a Jira browse URL built from the response host plus the issue key
  (from the input for edit/comment, from the response for create). Scans only the
  tool response, so a URL inside a comment body is not opened by mistake. Uses
  macOS `open` (else `xdg-open`); set `PST_NO_BROWSER=1` to skip a run.

## Session hooks

`scripts/pst-mode.rb` installs Ruby scripts (and `pst_common.rb`, the shared lib)
to `~/.claude/pst/bin/` and registers them once in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- `pst-session-start.rb` (`SessionStart`) writes `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` into
  `$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` so a skill can learn its own session id.
- `pst-guard.rb` (`PreToolUse`) runs the em-dash, model-tier, and merge gates
  above, only when armed.
- `pst-prompt-reminder.rb` (`UserPromptSubmit`) re-injects the compressed rule
  checklist each turn, leading with the delegate-by-default test (rule 1), only
  when armed. Drops the delegation lead under foreground mode.
- `pst-delegate-nudge.rb` (`PostToolUse`, `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`) counts inline
  implementation edits and, after the 3rd, surfaces a non-blocking reminder to
  delegate (rule 1). Never blocks. See "Delegation and foreground mode".
- `pst-open-on-post.rb` (`PostToolUse`, `Bash` and the Jira create/edit/comment
  MCP tools) opens the resulting page in the browser after an action under
  Patrick's name: a PR created, a PR/issue or Jira comment posted, a Jira issue
  created, or a description updated (rule 17). Side effect only, never blocks.
  Skip a run with `PST_NO_BROWSER=1`.
- `pst-session-end.rb` (`SessionEnd`) removes the per-session marker.

### Delegation and foreground mode

The delegate nudge counts only foreground grunt work: an edit counts only when
the file is in the **primary** git worktree. Delegated work runs in linked
worktrees (rules 2, 3), so those edits are never counted, which makes the nudge
correct whether or not sub-agents share the parent session id. It also skips
`*.md`, docs, lockfiles, `*.tfvars`, JSON/YAML/TOML config, and dotfiles, and
edits outside a repo (favoring under-counting). It is non-blocking and resets its
per-session counter after each reminder. Set `PST_DEBUG_DELEGATE=1` to log each
edit's session id, primary-worktree verdict, cwd, and path to
`~/.claude/pst/delegate/debug.log` for verification. Silence it when foreground
work is intentional (a planning or conversation-heavy session) via either:

- `pst-mode.rb foreground on` (creates `~/.claude/pst/foreground/<sid>`; `off`
  removes it). This also drops the per-turn reminder's delegation lead.
- env `PST_FOREGROUND_OK=1` for a single command.

A session is armed only if `~/.claude/pst/armed/<session_id>` exists, which
`/pst` creates (`/pst off` removes it). Otherwise the hooks are inert. Because
Claude Code binds hooks at session startup, in the session that first installs
the shim the guards engage from the next session onward; later sessions arm
immediately.

## Rule 20: OrbStack Docker for ephemeral infra and app servers

All common dev services (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.) AND application dev servers (Next.js, and similar Node/frontend apps) run as OrbStack Docker containers. Never install them natively, spin up bare k3s services for local dev, or run `npm run dev` on the host.

**Starting a tracked Postgres container:**

```sh
docker run -d --name myapp_pg_dev \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpass -e POSTGRES_DB=myapp_dev \
  -p 5432:5432 postgres:16
ruby scripts/pst-docker.rb register myapp_pg_dev
```

The session-end hook reaps it automatically via `docker stop` + `docker rm`.

**Starting a tracked Next.js dev server:**

```sh
docker run -d --name myapp_web_dev \
  -v $(pwd):/app -w /app \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  node:22-alpine sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"
ruby scripts/pst-docker.rb register myapp_web_dev
```

Same pattern for any Node/frontend app: volume-mount the repo, expose the dev port, register the container. Hot reload works via volume mounts.

**One-shot containers** (script runs, exits, gone): use `docker run --rm ...`. No tracking needed; Docker cleans up on exit.

**Helper: `scripts/pst-docker.rb`**

- `register <name> [port] [subdomain]` -- append to `~/.claude/pst/docker/<session_id>`; port and subdomain are optional (bare name is backward-compatible)
- `reap` -- stop and remove all tracked containers immediately (removes Caddy routes first for subdomain-registered entries)
- `list` -- show what is currently tracked (name, port, subdomain)

**Override:** `PST_KEEP_DOCKER=1` skips the reaper at session end (e.g., you want the container to survive for debugging).

### Tailscale access via shared Caddy proxy

| Approach                                          | Verdict                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shared host Caddy + wildcard `*.dev.pstaylor.net` | Recommended                                                               |
| `tailscale serve`                                 | Rejects: binds only to MagicDNS hostname, not `*.pstaylor.net` subdomains |
| Tailscale Funnel                                  | Rejects: exposes to public internet                                       |
| Per-app k3s deployment                            | Too heavy for ephemeral branches                                          |

**Starting a subdomain-accessible container:**

```sh
# start container with explicit host port
docker run -d --name myapp_feat_abc123 \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL=https://myapp-abc123.dev.pstaylor.net \
  -e AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true \
  -p 3001:3000 \
  node:22-alpine sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"

# add Caddy route (admin API; server name is srv0 by default)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:2019/config/apps/http/servers/srv0/routes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"match":[{"host":["myapp-abc123.dev.pstaylor.net"]}],"handle":[{"handler":"reverse_proxy","upstreams":[{"dial":"localhost:3001"}]}]}'

# register with port and subdomain for reaper
ruby scripts/pst-docker.rb register myapp_feat_abc123 3001 myapp-abc123.dev.pstaylor.net
```

**Escape hatch: OAuth-locked apps**

```sh
# NextAuth/Auth.js with Google/GitHub: keep localhost, access on host port
docker run -d --name myapp_oauth_dev \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  node:22-alpine sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"
ruby scripts/pst-docker.rb register myapp_oauth_dev 3000 localhost
```

Providers reject unregistered redirect hosts. Run OAuth-locked variants on localhost; use mock sessions or MailPit for A/B throwaway envs.

**Port collision:** Two branches of the same app both default to `:3000` internally. Always publish to a distinct host port (`-p 3001:3000`, `-p 3002:3000`, etc.) and record it in `register`.

**Prerequisites:**

- One `*.dev.pstaylor.net` A record in Route53 pointing at the proxy tailnet IP
- Caddy with `caddy-dns/route53` module (check with `caddy list-modules | grep route53`; rebuild with `xcaddy` if absent -- the Homebrew Caddy does not include it)
- Caddy admin API enabled at `localhost:2019`
- The Caddy TLS policy for `*.dev.pstaylor.net` must use a DNS-01 issuer (Route53); the internal issuer used for `.test` domains does not work for public subdomains

## Rule 22: Multi-repo orchestration ledger

Use this when two or more repos, directories, or parallel agent tasks are in flight during a single session. The ledger externalizes task state so new agents can be handed a compact bundle of what is already running, without re-explaining the world in each prompt.

`pst-mode.rb` calls `pst-ledger.rb init` automatically on arm, so the ledger exists by the time work begins.

**Key commands:**

- `pst-ledger.rb register <id> --repo <path> --intent <summary>` -- record a new task as pending when spawning an agent
- `pst-ledger.rb running <id>` -- mark a task as running once the agent starts
- `pst-ledger.rb done|fail <id> [--summary <notes>]` -- close out a task on completion or failure
- `pst-ledger.rb context` -- print a markdown table of all tasks, suitable for pasting as a context header into a new agent prompt

**Example orchestration:**

```sh
# Register tasks before spawning agents
ruby scripts/pst-ledger.rb register auth-refactor --repo ~/code/myapp --intent "refactor OAuth flow to use PKCE"
ruby scripts/pst-ledger.rb register api-client --repo ~/code/myapp-sdk --intent "update SDK to match new auth endpoints"

# Pass context to each new agent
ruby scripts/pst-ledger.rb context
# => paste the output at the top of each agent prompt

# Update status as work progresses
ruby scripts/pst-ledger.rb running auth-refactor
ruby scripts/pst-ledger.rb done auth-refactor --summary "PKCE implemented, tests green"
ruby scripts/pst-ledger.rb fail api-client --summary "blocked: endpoint contract not finalized"
```

Inspect interactively with `/pst:tasks`. Storage: `~/.claude/pst/ledger/<session-id>.json`.

## Rule 21: gh CLI for GitHub

`gh` is the default tool for anything touching GitHub. Use it over manual browser actions or raw API calls wherever possible.

**Common commands:**

- `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."` -- open a new pull request
- `gh pr view --web` -- open the current branch's PR in the browser
- `gh pr checks` -- view CI status for the current PR
- `gh pr list` -- list open PRs in the repo
- `gh pr merge <pr> --squash --admin` -- merge a PR (rule 5 guard enforces green CI)
- `gh issue list` -- list open issues
- `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."` -- open a new issue
- `gh release create <tag> --notes "..."` -- cut a release
- `gh pr comment <pr> --body "..."` -- post a comment on a PR

Read commands (`gh pr view`, `gh pr checks`, `gh issue view`, `gh pr list`) are always allowed, even in local-only mode (rule 18). Mutating commands (`gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`, `gh issue create`) are blocked in local-only mode; use `PST_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` to override once.

## Three-agent sequence (rule 19)

Default pattern for any feature or fix. Sequential: each stage feeds the next. Haiku helper stages (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5) do mechanical and compression work around the three thinking tiers so Opus and Sonnet tokens stay on reasoning and implementation. Stage 0 (Haiku classifier) gates the whole pipeline.

**Stage 0: Haiku classifier** (background, model: haiku, effort: low)
Gates the pipeline. Returns `trivial` or `substantive` based on the incoming request alone. Trivial tier is wired to the rule-2 Haiku-fits list (see "Rule detail and examples"). On any doubt, returns `substantive`.

Sample prompt:

```
Classify this engineering request as trivial or substantive.

trivial = a clear match to one of these (and nothing more): mechanical rename or
import-path rewrite; lint or format autofix; single-string copy change; version
or changelog bump; deleting already-identified dead code; boilerplate from an
exact template.

substantive = anything else, or any doubt.

Request:
<request text>

Return only JSON: {"verdict":"trivial"|"substantive","rationale":"<= 80 chars"}.
```

Output schema: `{ "verdict": "trivial" | "substantive", "rationale": "string <= 80 chars" }`.

**Stage 0.5: Haiku pre-flight context assembler** (background, model: haiku)
Runs after the classifier routes to the pipeline, before the planner. Scouts the repo so Opus spends tokens reasoning, not discovering.

Sample prompt: "Scout this repo for the request below: list the directory tree (depth 2), the last 15 git log lines, and the full contents of the most relevant files. Return only the bundle, no commentary. Request: `<request>`."

Output schema: `{ "tree": string, "git_log": string, "key_files": [ { "path": string, "content": string } ] }`. The planner receives this bundle as its repo context.

**Stage 1: Opus planner** (background, model: opus, effort: high)
Prompt it with the full request and the Stage 0.5 context bundle. Output: a numbered, step-by-step implementation plan with file targets and acceptance criteria.

**Stage 1.5: Haiku plan distiller** (background, model: haiku)
Compresses the verbose Opus plan into the exec summary the plan gate shows. Haiku compresses; Opus thinks.

Sample prompt: "Compress this implementation plan into a single summary of 320 characters or fewer that names what changes and the main files touched. No em dashes. Plan: `<plan>`."

Output schema: `{ "summary": string }` where `summary` is at most 320 characters and contains no U+2014.

**Stage 2: Plan gate** (foreground AskUserQuestion)
Show the Stage 1.5 distilled summary (320 characters max). Up to two follow-up questions if scope or approach needs settling. On approval (or no objection), proceed. On rejection, loop back to Stage 1 with the feedback.

**Stage 2.5: Haiku test scaffolder** (background, model: haiku, isolated worktree)
After gate approval, before implementation. Turns the plan's acceptance criteria into failing test stubs and fixture files so the implementer has a concrete target.

Sample prompt: "From these acceptance criteria, write test stubs and fixture files in the project's test framework. Stubs must assert the criteria and fail until implemented. Do not write production code. Criteria: `<criteria>`."

Output: test and fixture files committed in the worktree, plus `{ "files": [string], "framework": string }` passed to the implementer. Stage 3 continues in this same worktree so the implementer inherits the committed stubs.

**Stage 3: Sonnet implementer** (background, model: sonnet, effort: medium, same worktree as Stage 2.5 (inherited from the test-scaffolding commit))
Receives the approved plan verbatim plus the scaffolded tests. Implements exactly that plan: no scope additions, no creative departures, making the stubs pass. Commits in the worktree.

**Stage 3.5: Haiku lint/format pass** (background, model: haiku, same worktree)
After implementation, before validation. Mechanical cleanup so the validator focuses on correctness: em-dash check (`scripts/pst-emdash.rb check|prune`), import sorting, trailing whitespace, obvious style. No behavior changes.

Sample prompt: "In this worktree run the project formatter and import sorter, strip trailing whitespace, and run `scripts/pst-emdash.rb prune` on changed files. Report only what you changed. Change no behavior."

Output schema: `{ "changed_files": [string], "emdash_hits": number, "notes": string }`.

**Stage 4: Opus validator** (background, model: opus, effort: high)
Verifies: (1) every plan step was addressed, (2) no regressions introduced, (3) smoke/integration tests pass. If issues are found, applies fixes before reporting. Final report goes to Patrick.

**Stage 4.5: Haiku commit message writer** (background, model: haiku)
After validation passes. Reads the diff and the original plan, writes a conventional-commit message. Deterministic, well-scoped.

Sample prompt: "Write a conventional-commit message for this diff. Use the plan for intent. Subject under 72 chars, imperative mood, no em dashes. Body: what changed and why. Diff: `<diff>`. Plan: `<plan>`."

Output schema: `{ "subject": string, "body": string }`. The orchestrator appends the rule-10 co-author trailer before committing.

**Trivial threshold (skip the pipeline)**
The Stage 0 Haiku classifier owns this decision. It returns `trivial` only on a clear match to the rule-2 Haiku-tier list: mechanical rename, import-path rewrite, lint/format autofix, single-string copy change, version or changelog bump, deleting already-identified dead code, or boilerplate from an exact template. Any doubt returns `substantive`, making the pipeline the default.

## Order of operations for a typical change

0. Run the pipeline before opening a PR: Haiku classify, Haiku pre-flight, Opus plan, Haiku distill, plan-gate approval, Haiku scaffold tests, Sonnet implement, Haiku lint/format, Opus validate, Haiku commit message (rule 19). Haiku stages handle mechanical work; Opus and Sonnet own thinking and implementation.
1. For feature/fix work, planning and validation run as rule-19 pipeline stages (background Opus); the foreground keeps only orchestration, choices, and gate decisions. For all other work, plan in the foreground (Opus high) and fan implementation out to background Sonnet agents in isolated worktrees (rules 1, 2, 3).
2. Open a PR (rule 5). Separate refactor commits from behavior changes (rule 15).
3. Get CI green with root-cause fixes (rules 5, 6). De-slop the diff (rule 12).
4. Run adversarial review; implement findings; re-review to clean (rule 7).
5. For a cluster app, run the local k8s QA arsenal with discernment and prove it
   works end-to-end (rules 8, 9, 14). If CI auto-deploys to remote on merge, do
   this BEFORE merge via blue-green.
6. Land by the chosen merge mode: admin-bypass squash on green CI, auto-merge on
   approval, or hand off merge-ready (rule 5, merge-guard enforced).
7. If not gated pre-merge, validate locally before any remote promotion (rule 8).
8. Run `pst-worktrees.rb` and offer to prune orphaned worktrees (rule 4).

## Rule 25 -- Context hygiene and output compression

**Provenance:** inspired by [headroom](https://github.com/headroomlabs-ai/headroom), a context-compression research project.

### Pre-execution output limiting

Before running bash commands that may produce large output, append limiting flags:

| Scenario          | Limiting flag                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `git log`         | `git log --oneline -20`                      |
| `find`            | `find . -name "*.rb" \| head -50`            |
| `cat` large file  | Use `Read` with `offset`/`limit` instead     |
| JSON API response | `jq '{keys: keys, sample: .[0:2]}'`          |
| Log file          | `grep -E 'ERROR\|WARN' app.log \| tail -100` |

### Content-type routing

| Content type | What to extract                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| JSON         | Schema shape + key fields + item count                           |
| Logs         | Errors and warnings first; summary of rest                       |
| Code         | Read with `offset`/`limit`; avoid full-file reads on large files |
| Prose / docs | Key points only; skip boilerplate                                |

### CCR pattern (Compress-Cache-Retrieve)

For large intermediate artifacts that must persist across agents:

1. **Compress:** distill to the minimum needed (schema, summary, key facts).
2. **Cache:** write to the session scratchpad directory with a descriptive filename (e.g. `schema-users-table.json`).
3. **Retrieve:** downstream agents use the Read tool on that path; pass the path in the agent prompt.

This avoids re-passing large blobs through the context chain; the scratchpad persists for the session lifetime.

### Cache-preservation note

Anthropic's prompt cache keys on an exact contiguous prefix. Mutating or compressing earlier messages in an active session invalidates the cache from the first changed token onward. Compression helps future turns by keeping the context smaller; it does not preserve the current cached prefix. Only append to an active session; do not rewrite earlier content.

### Verbosity-at-tail

Put the most load-bearing instruction last in a long prompt -- models weight the tail of a prompt more heavily. In practice: lead a response with the actionable summary; put verbose output, debug traces, and raw data at the end. This is a drafting heuristic, not a guarantee.

## Auto memory (rule 26)

Auto memory is the **cross-session**, **Claude-written** knowledge layer. CLAUDE.md is human-written standing rules. They are complementary: CLAUDE.md injects every session; auto memory entries are loaded on demand from `~/.claude/projects/<repo>/memory/`.

### Save/skip taxonomy

| Save                                                                                     | Skip                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Root-caused CI failure + fix (rule 6)                                                    | PR numbers, SHAs, ledger contents                    |
| Repo-scoped tournament winner + one-line rationale (rule 24)                             | One-off task status or in-progress work              |
| Recurring DROPPED finding patterns from `pst:code-review` (calibrated false positives)   | Anything already in CLAUDE.md or derivable from code |
| Discovered build/bootstrap commands (`npm ci --frozen-lockfile`, package-manager quirks) | Ephemeral session state                              |
| Recurring VERIFIED finding patterns that signal a persistent design blind spot           | Transient observations that won't recur              |

### MEMORY.md-as-index discipline

`MEMORY.md` is a concise, flat index -- one line per entry, under ~150 characters. Only the first 200 lines (25 KB) load at session start. Push detail to topic files:

| Topic                                             | Filename                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |

### Read-before-derive heuristic (rule 19, Stage 0.5)

Before the Haiku pre-flight agent scouts the repo, it must read `~/.claude/projects/<repo>/memory/MEMORY.md` (if it exists) and any relevant topic files. Scout only facts not already in memory. This prevents redundant re-discovery of build commands, package manager quirks, and other stable repo facts on every run.

### Ledger vs auto memory boundary (rule 22)

| Ledger (`pst-ledger.rb`)                                  | Auto memory                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Session-scoped; dies at session end                       | Persists across sessions                           |
| Task registration, in-flight status, sibling coordination | Durable learnings that reduce future re-derivation |
| Who is doing what right now                               | What we have learned about this repo over time     |

### Validation

Run `/pst:claude-md` to validate `MEMORY.md` structure (size, frontmatter, index format). That skill checks compliance of the auto-memory directory; this rule governs what to write and when.

## Stacked PR order (rule 27)

**Terminology:**

- **Top of stack** (downstack): the PR whose base branch is `main` (or whatever the shared base is). This is the first PR to merge.
- **Bottom of stack** (upstack): the outermost PR, stacked on top of one or more others. This merges last.

**Correct merge order:** top to bottom -- base-targeting PR first, outermost PR last.

**Example stack (3 PRs):**

```
main
 └── feat/auth-core          (PR #10, targets main)        <-- merge first
      └── feat/auth-ui       (PR #11, targets feat/auth-core)
           └── feat/auth-e2e (PR #12, targets feat/auth-ui) <-- merge last
```

Merge PR #10 into main, rebase PR #11 onto main, then merge PR #11, rebase PR #12, then merge PR #12. Never touch PR #12 while PR #10 is unmerged -- the diff is wrong and the review is misleading.

**Why it matters:** reviewing or merging upstack PRs before downstack ones inflates the upstack diff with changes that belong to downstack PRs, making review noisy and defeating the purpose of keeping stacked PR diffs small.

## Test plan auto-execution (rule 28)

Every test plan item in a PR must be classified and acted on before the PR is surfaced for human review. Three buckets:

### Bucket taxonomy

| Bucket                    | Definition                                                                                                                             | Action                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Shell-executable**      | Contains a runnable command: `grep`, `find`, `curl` (localhost), `git`, `docker`, `pnpm`/`npm`/`ruby`/`python`, lint, typecheck, build | Run in PR worktree; tick on pass |
| **Environment-dependent** | Requires live external service, remote URL, physical hardware, or credentials not in worktree                                          | Skip with labeled reason         |
| **Narrative/manual**      | Describes a human action (click X, verify Y visually) with no shell equivalent                                                         | Skip with labeled reason         |

### Canonical example (shell-executable)

From cove PR #58:

```
- [ ] `grep -rn 'kc \|require_cluster\|rollout' scripts/mail-load.sh scripts/gmail-load.sh scripts/cove-mail-sync.sh` returns nothing
```

This is shell-executable. Run the command in the PR worktree. Pass = exit 0 with empty stdout (the item asserts "returns nothing"). Tick `- [x]` on pass. If the grep finds matches, leave `- [ ]` and report in the validation comment.

### PATCH mechanism

After running all shell-executable items, update the PR body with ticked checkboxes and inline skip annotations:

```bash
# Build the updated body string (replace - [ ] with - [x] for passing items,
# append _(skipped: <reason>)_ for skipped items)
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$NUMBER \
  --method PATCH \
  --field body="$UPDATED_BODY"
```

Then post a single `<!-- pst:test-plan-validation -->` comment with the results table before calling Phase 8.

### Skip annotation format

Inline, immediately after the item text:

- [ ] Deploy to staging and verify login flow _(skipped: requires live OAuth credentials)_
- [ ] Check hardware sensor output _(skipped: physical device not in worktree)_

## Business context layer (Phase 6)

The optional `org` field in project config bridges the project layer to the
`~/.ctx/` business context mirror. When present, the shim injects matching
context documents on the first turn of each session.

**User-global** (`~/.claude/pst/projects.json`):

```json
{ "name": "great-grants", "org": "servant-io", "stacks": [...], "repos": [...] }
```

**Repo-local** (`.pst/project.json`):

```json
{ "name": "great-grants", "org": "servant-io", "stacks": [...] }
```

The `org` value must match the subdirectory name under `~/.ctx/orgs/`. The field
is optional and backward-compatible -- omitting it disables context injection
for that project.
